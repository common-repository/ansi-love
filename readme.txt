AnsiLove will enable you to upload ANSI files which will be converted to PNG images on the fly. 

== Description ==

AnsiLove is a plugin which uses the free AnsiLove library from Frederic Cambus (MIT). This plugin will enable you to upload ANSI files to your media folder. The ANSI files will be converted to PNG on the fly.

* Show your old skool ANSI files!
* Can create transparent backgrounds after upload
* Written as class to avoid conflicts!

_Showcase some of the ACiD artwork ;)_

== Installation ==

1. Upload/Install AnsiLove to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Upload .ANS file
4. Behold the ANSI file in PNG glory ;)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why create something like this? =

I have been running an BBS (bulletin board) using Remote Access (DOS program) from 1991 to 1997. Now I wanted to showcase some of the ANSI artwork which I created for this board. 

When I came accross the AnsiLove tools I immediately went to work to incorporate this in my WordPress blog.

= Why is there an .ANS file in my media uploads =

The .ANS file is there for restore and/or transparent background functionality. Also I will write a small shortcode so your visitors can download the original ANSI file if you want to offering it.

Please note that this .ANS file will be remove when you remove the converted .PNG image from your library.

= Image Cleanup plugin =

I could not have developed this plugin without the Image Cleanup plugin as it gave me insight on how the images were generated (or not at all ;).

It saved my database and media folder from a lot of clutter!
